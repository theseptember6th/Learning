    "To summarize the key idea from the video:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The **average value** of a function \\( f(x) \\) over an interval \\([a, b]\\) is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "  $$\n",
    "  f_{\\text{avg}} = \\frac{1}{b-a} \\int_a^b f(x) \\,dx\n",
    "  $$\n",
    "\n",
    "- This formula makes sense because:\n",
    "  1. The integral \\( \\int_a^b f(x) \\,dx \\) represents the **signed area** under the curve.\n",
    "  2. Dividing by \\( b-a \\) (the width of the interval) gives the average height of the function over that range.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The relationship between **area and slope**:\n",
    "  - The integral is related to the **change in an antiderivative** \\( F(x) \\), where \\( F(x) \\) satisfies \\( F'(x) = f(x) \\).\n",
    "  - The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus tells us:\n",
    "\n",
    "    $$\n",
    "    \\int_a^b f(x) \\,dx = F(b) - F(a)\n",
    "    $$\n",
    "\n",
    "  - This means the **average value** of \\( f(x) \\) can also be written as:\n",
    "\n",
    "    $$\n",
    "    f_{\\text{avg}} = \\frac{F(b) - F(a)}{b-a}\n",
    "    $$\n",
    "\n",
    "  - The right-hand side is simply the **slope of the secant line** connecting \\( (a, F(a)) \\) and \\( (b, F(b)) \\), meaning that the average value of \\( f(x) \\) over an interval is connected to the **average rate of change** of its antiderivative.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is why **integrals and derivatives are inverses**â€”the derivative gives the instantaneous rate of change, while the integral accumulates changes over an interval. The average value of a function over an interval corresponds to the slope of the secant line on its antiderivative."
