    "## **6. Summary**\n",
    "1. **Implicit differentiation** allows us to differentiate equations where \\( y \\) is not explicitly written as a function of \\( x \\).\n",
    "2. It relies on the **chain rule**, since \\( y \\) depends on \\( x \\).\n",
    "3. In **related rates**, differentiation is done with respect to **time (t)**.\n",
    "4. Both methods track how changes in one variable affect another.\n",
    "5. The ladder problem and the circle problem share the same **mathematical structure**.\n"
