    "# Understanding Euler's Number \\( e \\) in Calculus\n",
    "\n",
    "Euler's number, denoted as \\( e \\), is one of the most important constants in mathematics. It appears in calculus, differential equations, probability, and many natural growth and decay processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Exponential Functions and Their Derivatives\n",
    "\n",
    "An exponential function has the general form:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ f(t) = a^t $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where \\( a \\) is a positive constant base. The derivative of an exponential function is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\frac{d}{dt} a^t = k \\cdot a^t $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where \\( k \\) is a constant that depends on the base \\( a \\).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1. Computing the Constant \\( k \\)\n",
    "The value of \\( k \\) is related to the natural logarithm of \\( a \\):\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\frac{d}{dt} a^t = \\ln(a) \\cdot a^t $$\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "- If \\( a = 2 \\), then \\( k = \\ln(2) \\approx 0.6931 \\).\n",
    "- If \\( a = 3 \\), then \\( k = \\ln(3) \\approx 1.0986 \\).\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. The Special Case of \\( e \\)\n",
    "Euler's number \\( e \\) is defined as the unique base for which the proportionality constant \\( k \\) equals **1**:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\frac{d}{dt} e^t = e^t $$\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that the function \\( e^t \\) is special because its rate of change at any point is exactly equal to its value at that point.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.1. Intuition Behind \\( e \\)\n",
    "The number \\( e \\) is approximately:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ e \\approx 2.718281828... $$\n",
    "\n",
    "It arises naturally in many contexts, including:\n",
    "- **Continuous compound interest**: If an initial investment grows at a rate proportional to its size, it follows an exponential function based on \\( e \\).\n",
    "- **Population growth and decay**: Many biological and physical processes follow exponential models.\n",
    "- **Differential equations**: Many fundamental equations in physics and engineering involve functions of \\( e^t \\).\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Derivation of \\( e \\)\n",
    "One way to define \\( e \\) is as a limit:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ e = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\left( 1 + \\frac{1}{n} \\right)^n $$\n",
    "\n",
    "This expression comes from compound interest, where interest is applied an increasing number of times per year.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Conclusion\n",
    "Euler's number \\( e \\) is the natural base for exponential functions because it simplifies differentiation and integration. The function \\( e^t \\) is unique in that it is its own derivative, making it fundamental in many areas of mathematics and science.\n",
