    "The **Shi-Tomasi Corner Detection** method is a variant of the **Harris Corner Detection** algorithm. It improves upon Harris corner detection by providing a more reliable and simpler approach to identifying corners in images. This method is often used in computer vision tasks, such as object recognition, image tracking, and 3D reconstruction.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Differences from Harris Corner Detection:\n",
    "1. **Eigenvalue-based criterion**: Instead of calculating the Harris corner response function **R** (which involves both eigenvalues and their sum), the Shi-Tomasi method directly uses the **smaller eigenvalue** (Î»_min) as the criterion for detecting corners.\n",
    "2. **Simplified formula**: Shi-Tomasi method calculates the eigenvalues of the **structure tensor** and selects corners based on the **minimum eigenvalue**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Shi-Tomasi Corner Detection Formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Shi-Tomasi method** uses the **minimum eigenvalue** of the structure tensor (which is related to the image gradient) to determine the strength of a corner.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Structure Tensor (M)**:\n",
    "\n",
    "The structure tensor \\( M \\) at a point is defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "M = \\begin{bmatrix}\n",
    "I_x^2 & I_x I_y \\\\\n",
    "I_x I_y & I_y^2\n",
    "\\end{bmatrix}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- \\( I_x \\) is the image gradient in the **x-direction**.\n",
    "- \\( I_y \\) is the image gradient in the **y-direction**.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Eigenvalues**:\n",
    "\n",
    "The eigenvalues (\\( \\lambda_1 \\), \\( \\lambda_2 \\)) of the structure tensor are computed using:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\lambda_1, \\lambda_2 = \\text{eigenvalues of } M\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Corner Decision**:\n",
    "\n",
    "The Shi-Tomasi method uses the **minimum eigenvalue** \\( \\lambda_{\\min} \\) to detect corners. A corner is identified if:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\lambda_{\\min} > \\text{threshold}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where the threshold is a user-defined parameter that helps filter out weak corners. Points with large \\( \\lambda_{\\min} \\) values correspond to strong corners, while points with small \\( \\lambda_{\\min} \\) values correspond to flat regions or edges.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Comparison with Harris Corner Detection:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Harris**: The Harris method uses a combination of both eigenvalues (\\( \\lambda_1 \\) and \\( \\lambda_2 \\)) to calculate a corner score **R**. Large **R** indicates a corner.\n",
    "- **Shi-Tomasi**: The Shi-Tomasi method focuses only on the **minimum eigenvalue** \\( \\lambda_{\\min} \\), which makes it simpler and computationally more efficient than Harris.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary of Shi-Tomasi Method:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Corner Criterion**: Uses the minimum eigenvalue (\\( \\lambda_{\\min} \\)) of the structure tensor.\n",
    "- **Simpler and faster**: Easier to compute than the Harris method since it avoids combining both eigenvalues in a single response function.\n",
    "- **Thresholding**: Corners are selected based on whether \\( \\lambda_{\\min} \\) exceeds a predefined threshold value.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Applications:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Tracking**: Shi-Tomasi corners are widely used in optical flow and tracking algorithms, where feature points need to be detected and tracked across video frames.\n",
    "- **Feature Matching**: In 3D reconstruction and object recognition, Shi-Tomasi corners can be used to find robust keypoints for matching across different images."
