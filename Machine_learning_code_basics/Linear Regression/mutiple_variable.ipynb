    "This tutorial covers **multiple linear regression** using Python, specifically for predicting home prices based on features like **area, number of bedrooms, and age**. Below is a detailed breakdown of the key concepts and steps involved.\n",

    "\n",
    "## **1. Introduction to Multiple Linear Regression**\n",
    "Multiple Linear Regression is an extension of Simple Linear Regression. It allows us to predict a **dependent variable (target variable)** using **multiple independent variables (features).**  \n",
    "\n",
    "### **1.1 Linear Regression Equation**\n",
    "For multiple variables, the equation is:\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "\\text{Price} = m_1 \\times \\text{Area} + m_2 \\times \\text{Bedrooms} + m_3 \\times \\text{Age} + b\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- \\( m_1, m_2, m_3 \\) are **coefficients** (weights assigned to each variable).\n",
    "- \\( b \\) is the **intercept**.\n",
    "- **Area, Bedrooms, and Age** are independent variables (features).\n",
    "- **Price** is the dependent variable (target).\n",
    "\n",
    "The equation can be generalized for \\( n \\) variables as:\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "Y = m_1X_1 + m_2X_2 + ... + m_nX_n + b\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **2. Preprocessing the Data**\n",
    "Before applying a machine learning model, we must **clean and preprocess** the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2.1 Handling Missing Data**\n",
    "- In the dataset, **some bedroom values are missing**.\n",
    "- To handle this, we replace the missing values with the **median** (middle value) of the column.  \n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  median_bedrooms = math.floor(df.bedrooms.median())\n",
    "  df.bedrooms.fillna(median_bedrooms, inplace=True)\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "- **Why use the median?**  \n",
    "  The median is **less affected by outliers** compared to the mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2.2 Checking Linear Relationship**\n",
    "- The relationship between each **feature** and **price** should be **linear**.\n",
    "- From the dataset, we observe:\n",
    "  - As **area** and **bedrooms** increase â†’ **Price increases**.\n",
    "  - As **age** increases â†’ **Price decreases**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we see **linear relationships**, we can apply **linear regression**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **3. Training the Model**\n",
    "### **3.1 Import Required Libraries**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import pandas as pd\n",
    "import numpy as np\n",
    "import math\n",
    "from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **3.2 Load Data**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "df = pd.read_csv(\"home_prices.csv\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "- The dataset contains **home prices** along with **area, bedrooms, and age**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **3.3 Create and Train the Model**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "reg = LinearRegression()\n",
    "reg.fit(df[['area', 'bedrooms', 'age']], df.price)\n",
    "```\n",
    "- `.fit()` method trains the model by finding the **best coefficients** (slopes) for the equation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **3.4 Understanding Coefficients**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "print(reg.coef_)  # [m1, m2, m3]\n",
    "print(reg.intercept_)  # b\n",
    "```\n",
    "- The **coefficients (m1, m2, m3)** represent how much the price changes **per unit change** in each feature.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **4. Making Predictions**\n",
    "Once the model is trained, we can predict house prices for new data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **4.1 Predicting for a Home (3000 sq ft, 3 bedrooms, 40 years old)**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "reg.predict([[3000, 3, 40]])\n",
    "```\n",
    "- Example output: **$498,408**  \n",
    "  If we change the **age to 15**, the price increases, showing how **age affects the price**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **4.2 Formula-Based Prediction**\n",
    "The predicted price is calculated as:\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "\\text{Price} = m_1 \\times 3000 + m_2 \\times 3 + m_3 \\times 40 + b\n",
    "\\]\n",

    "## **5. Exercise: Salary Prediction**\n",
    "The exercise involves building a **multiple linear regression model** to predict a **candidate's salary** based on:\n",
    "1. **Years of experience**\n",
    "2. **Written test score**\n",
    "3. **Personal interview score**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **5.1 Challenges in Dataset**\n",
    "- Missing experience values â†’ Assume them as **zero**.\n",
    "- Convert **text experience** to numbers using `word2number` module.\n",
    "- Missing test/interview scores â†’ Fill with **median**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **5.2 Predict Salaries**\n",
    "- Candidate 1: **2 years experience, scores 9 & 6**.\n",
    "- Candidate 2: **12 years experience, scores 10 & 10**.\n",
