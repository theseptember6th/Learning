    "This transcript discusses several important concepts in linear algebra, primarily related to vectors, linear combinations, span, and basis vectors. Here are some key takeaways:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Vector Coordinates and Scalar Multiplication**: Each coordinate in a vector (like in the example (3, -2)) can be viewed as a scalar that scales a corresponding unit vector (i-hat for x-direction and j-hat for y-direction). The vector is described as a sum of these scaled unit vectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Basis Vectors**: The two special vectors i-hat and j-hat in the 2D plane are the basis vectors. These vectors help define a coordinate system, and any 2D vector can be described as a linear combination of them. Basis vectors can be chosen differently, resulting in a different coordinate system.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Linear Combinations**: A linear combination involves scaling vectors by scalars and then adding them together. In the case of 2D vectors, altering the scalars lets you reach any possible point in the plane, provided the vectors are not aligned (in which case the span is limited to a line).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Span**: The span of a set of vectors is the set of all possible vectors you can reach through linear combinations of those vectors. For two vectors, the span is the entire plane unless the vectors are collinear (in which case the span is just a line). In 3D space, the span of two vectors defines a flat sheet, and adding a third vector that is not in the plane formed by the first two will span the entire 3D space.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Linear Independence**: If vectors in a set contribute new directions to the span, they are linearly independent. If a vector can be expressed as a linear combination of others, the set is linearly dependent. \n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Basis**: A basis is a set of linearly independent vectors that span a space. This definition makes sense because you need a minimal set of vectors that can generate the entire space through linear combinations.\n",

    "These ideas are foundational for understanding vector spaces, their structure, and how transformations work in linear algebra."

    "In this video, the concept of **linear transformations** is explained, focusing on how they can be represented using **matrices**. A linear transformation takes an input vector and produces an output vector while maintaining two key properties: straight lines remain straight and the origin stays fixed. \n",

    "The transformation of space can be described using matrices, where the columns of the matrix represent the new positions of the basis vectors (i-hat and j-hat). By multiplying a vector by this matrix, we can find where it lands after the transformation.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. **Linear Transformations Recap**: Linear transformations are functions that map vectors to other vectors while keeping grid lines parallel and the origin fixed. A matrix represents a linear transformation by showing where the basis vectors (i-hat and j-hat) land after the transformation.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Composition of Transformations**: When two transformations are applied in sequence, their overall effect can be represented by a new matrix. The video explains how to compute this composition by applying the transformations step by step and combining them into a single matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Matrix Multiplication**: The multiplication of matrices corresponds to applying one transformation and then another. The new matrix that results from multiplying two matrices captures the effect of both transformations. The order of multiplication matters, as different orders of transformations can lead to different results.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Associative Property of Matrix Multiplication**: The video touches on the fact that matrix multiplication is associative, meaning the order in which matrices are multiplied doesn't affect the final result, which can be understood conceptually by viewing matrix multiplication as applying transformations in sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "The overall message is that understanding matrix multiplication as a sequence of transformations helps simplify the process of interpreting and computing the effects of combined transformations."

The video focuses on the fact that linear transformations in 3D can be visualized as manipulating a grid in three-dimensional space, where the transformations maintain parallelism and evenly spaced lines, while keeping the origin fixed.\n",
    "\n",

The matrix that describes the transformation can be constructed by tracking where each of these basis vectors goes in space. This results in a 3x3 matrix, where the columns represent the new coordinates of the basis vectors after the transformation.\n",

    "This video discusses the concept of the **determinant** of a linear transformation, which measures how much the transformation scales areas (in 2D) or volumes (in 3D). Here's a summary of the key points from the transcript:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Linear Transformations and Stretching/Squishing**: A linear transformation can either stretch or squish space. For example, a matrix with columns `[3, 0]` and `[0, 2]` stretches space by a factor of 3 in one direction and by 2 in the other direction, making a unit square into a 2x3 rectangle, scaling its area by a factor of 6.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Shear Transformation**: A shear transformation, such as one represented by a matrix with columns `[1, 0]` and `[1, 1]`, preserves the area of the transformed unit square, even though it changes its shape into a parallelogram.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Determinant**: The determinant of a matrix gives the scaling factor of areas (2D) or volumes (3D) under the corresponding linear transformation. A determinant of 1 means no area or volume change, while a determinant of 0 means the space is squished into a lower dimension, such as a line or point.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Orientation and Negative Determinants**: A negative determinant indicates a flip or inversion of the space’s orientation, such as flipping a sheet of paper. The absolute value of the determinant still tells you the factor by which the area or volume is scaled.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **3D Transformations**: In 3D, the determinant measures how much the volume of a unit cube is scaled. If the determinant is zero, it indicates that the transformation squashes the cube into a lower-dimensional object, such as a plane or line.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Computing the Determinant**: The determinant of a 2x2 matrix is computed as `ad - bc` for a matrix `[a, b; c, d]`. The formula relates to how the matrix stretches or squishes the unit square into a parallelogram, with the `ad` term contributing to the area and the `bc` term adjusting for diagonal stretching or squishing.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Multiplication Property of Determinants**: The determinant of the product of two matrices is the product of their individual determinants.\n",
    "\n",
    "This understanding of determinants provides the foundation for further exploring how matrices transform space, both geometrically and algebraically. The main takeaway is that the determinant tells you how a transformation scales areas (in 2D) or volumes (in 3D), and whether it changes the orientation of space."

    "In this video, the main ideas are to develop an intuitive understanding of inverse matrices, column space, rank, and null space, all through the lens of linear transformations. Here's a breakdown of the key concepts:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Linear Systems of Equations**: \n",
    "   - When you have a system of linear equations, it can be expressed as a matrix-vector multiplication problem: \\( A \\times X = V \\), where \\( A \\) is a matrix containing the coefficients of the variables, \\( X \\) is the vector of variables, and \\( V \\) is the constant vector.\n",
    "   - This forms the basis for understanding how matrices and vectors interact in a geometric way. The goal is to find a vector \\( X \\) that, after applying a linear transformation (represented by matrix \\( A \\)), results in vector \\( V \\).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Determinant and Inverses**:\n",
    "   - If the determinant of matrix \\( A \\) is non-zero, the transformation associated with \\( A \\) doesn't squash space into a lower dimension. In this case, you can reverse the transformation using the inverse matrix, \\( A^{-1} \\), to find the solution \\( X \\).\n",
    "   - If the determinant is zero, the transformation squashes space into a lower dimension, and the inverse doesn't exist. However, it's still possible to have a solution if \\( V \\) lies within the \"squished\" dimension.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Rank of a Matrix**:\n",
    "   - The rank of a matrix refers to the number of dimensions in its output. For example, if a 2x2 matrix squashes space onto a line, the rank is 1. If it spans the entire 2D plane, the rank is 2.\n",
    "   - A full-rank matrix has the maximum rank possible for its size, meaning its transformation spans the full dimensionality of space (e.g., a 2x2 matrix with rank 2 spans 2D space).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Column Space**:\n",
    "   - The column space of a matrix is the span of its columns. It represents all possible outputs of the matrix transformation. The rank of a matrix is equivalent to the dimension of its column space.\n",
    "   - A full-rank matrix has a column space that spans the entire space (for a 2x2 matrix, it spans 2D space). For matrices that aren't full rank, the column space might be lower-dimensional, and some vectors could land on the zero vector.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Null Space (Kernel)**:\n",
    "   - The null space (or kernel) of a matrix is the set of all vectors that get squashed to the zero vector when the transformation is applied. These vectors don't affect the outcome of the transformation.\n",
    "   - In the context of a system of equations, the null space represents all possible solutions to the equation when \\( V \\) is the zero vector.\n",

    "### 1. **Linear Transformations and Matrices**\n",
    "Linear transformations are mathematical operations that take vectors in one space and map them to vectors in another space. A matrix represents such a transformation. In this case, we're looking at transformations between **spaces of different dimensions** using non-square matrices. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Square Matrices and Simple Transformations**\n",
    "In earlier videos, the transformations discussed were between vectors in spaces with the same dimension. For example:\n",
    "- **2D to 2D**: A 2x2 matrix encodes a transformation that maps 2D vectors to other 2D vectors.\n",
    "- **3D to 3D**: A 3x3 matrix encodes a transformation that maps 3D vectors to other 3D vectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "In these cases, the input and output spaces have the same dimensions, and thus the matrix is square (number of rows = number of columns).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Non-Square Matrices and Transformations Between Different Dimensions**\n",
    "Now, the focus is on **non-square matrices**. These matrices represent transformations where the input space and the output space have different dimensions. Let's go through the examples provided in the video:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **2D to 3D Transformation**\n",
    "- Suppose you have a **2D space** (input space) and a **3D space** (output space).\n",
    "- In 2D, you have two basis vectors: **i-hat** (unit vector along the x-axis) and **j-hat** (unit vector along the y-axis).\n",
    "- A transformation might map these basis vectors to new points in the 3D space. For example:\n",
    "  - The **i-hat vector** (1, 0) might map to the point **(2, -1, -2)** in 3D space.\n",
    "  - The **j-hat vector** (0, 1) might map to the point **(0, 1, 1)** in 3D space.\n",
    "  \n",
    "This transformation can be represented by a **3x2 matrix**. Here’s why:\n",
    "- The matrix has 3 rows because the output space is 3D (each output is a 3D vector with 3 coordinates).\n",
    "- The matrix has 2 columns because the input space is 2D (we only need two basis vectors to describe the space).\n",
    "\n",
    "The matrix for this transformation looks like this:\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "\\begin{bmatrix}\n",
    "2 & 0 \\\\\n",
    "-1 & 1 \\\\\n",
    "-2 & 1\n",
    "\\end{bmatrix}\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "The **columns of the matrix** represent the new coordinates of the basis vectors (i-hat and j-hat) in the 3D space. The first column represents where **i-hat** goes (2, -1, -2), and the second column represents where **j-hat** goes (0, 1, 1).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Geometric Interpretation**: The transformation takes a 2D vector (with just x and y coordinates) and maps it into a 3D space (with x, y, and z coordinates). The result will lie on a 2D plane in 3D space, as both i-hat and j-hat are mapped to vectors that lie in a plane (the column space of the matrix).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **3D to 2D Transformation**\n",
    "Now, suppose we’re transforming from **3D space** (input) to **2D space** (output):\n",
    "- The input space is 3D, so you have 3 basis vectors (one along each of the x, y, and z axes).\n",
    "- The output space is 2D, so you only have 2 basis vectors, one for each dimension of the 2D space.\n",
    "  \n",
    "This type of transformation can be represented by a **2x3 matrix**. Here’s why:\n",
    "- The matrix has 2 rows because the output space is 2D.\n",
    "- The matrix has 3 columns because the input space is 3D (each column represents the transformation of one of the 3D basis vectors).\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, a transformation might take the following vectors:\n",
    "- **(1, 0, 0)** (along the x-axis) might map to **(2, 1)** (in the 2D plane),\n",
    "- **(0, 1, 0)** (along the y-axis) might map to **(-1, 3)**,\n",
    "- **(0, 0, 1)** (along the z-axis) might map to **(0, 0)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "This transformation would be represented by the matrix:\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "\\begin{bmatrix}\n",
    "2 & -1 & 0 \\\\\n",
    "1 & 3 & 0\n",
    "\\end{bmatrix}\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "The **columns of the matrix** represent the new positions of the basis vectors in 2D space. For example, the first column is **(2, 1)**, the transformation of **(1, 0, 0)**, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Geometric Interpretation**: This transformation projects the 3D vectors onto a 2D plane. The resulting vectors will lose the third dimension (the z-coordinate) and become 2D vectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **2D to 1D Transformation**\n",
    "You can also have transformations that reduce the number of dimensions further. For example, a **2D to 1D transformation** takes 2D vectors and maps them to a 1D space (just a number on a line).\n",
    "\n",
    "This is represented by a **1x2 matrix**, which might look like this:\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "\\begin{bmatrix}\n",
    "1 & -2\n",
    "\\end{bmatrix}\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "The two columns of this matrix represent where the basis vectors land in 1D space. Since we're transforming to 1D, each of these two columns will only contain a single number, indicating where the corresponding basis vector (i-hat or j-hat) lands along the 1D number line.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Geometric Interpretation**: This transformation \"squashes\" the 2D vectors into just a number, which can be thought of as projecting the 2D space onto a single dimension.\n",
    "\n",
    "The reason this works geometrically is that while the transformation reduces the dimensionality, it still preserves the key feature of linear transformations: **parallelism**. Gridlines (or the spaces between vectors) remain evenly spaced even when projected to the number line.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **Key Insights from the Video**\n",
    "- Non-square matrices are used to represent transformations between spaces of **different dimensions** (like 2D to 3D or 3D to 2D).\n",
    "- **Matrix multiplication** helps encode how these transformations work in terms of input vectors and their corresponding output vectors.\n",
    "- **Geometrically**, transformations map the input vectors (in a lower-dimensional space) into higher-dimensional spaces (or vice versa), but they preserve the properties of linearity, like gridlines remaining parallel and evenly spaced.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. **Connection to Dot Products**\n",
    "In the last part of the video, the speaker mentions that 2D to 1D transformations have a connection to the **dot product**. Specifically, a 1x2 matrix can be thought of as performing a dot product between a vector and a fixed vector that specifies how to \"squeeze\" the 2D vector into a 1D value. This transformation has important ties to projection in vector spaces, which will be explored further in the next video.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, non-square matrices allow for transformations that map vectors from spaces of one dimension to another, such as from 2D to 3D or from 3D to 2D. These transformations are useful for a variety of applications, including dimensionality reduction, projection, and encoding transformations in machine learning, computer graphics, and data science."

    "**Change of Basis - Detailed Explanation**\n",
    "\n",
    "The video you're referring to introduces the concept of changing the basis in linear algebra. To fully understand this, let's break it down into simpler terms and explain everything in detail:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Basic Concept of Coordinates and Basis Vectors\n",
    "\n",
    "In 2D space, we usually describe vectors using a standard coordinate system (commonly known as the Cartesian coordinate system). A vector in 2D can be described by two components, say (3, 2), where:\n",
    "- 3 is the horizontal displacement, and\n",
    "- 2 is the vertical displacement.\n",
    "\n",
    "These numbers are referred to as **coordinates**, and they represent how far the vector moves along the **standard basis vectors** of the coordinate system:\n",
    "- **i-hat** (also called **i**) represents a unit vector pointing to the right (along the x-axis),\n",
    "- **j-hat** (also called **j**) represents a unit vector pointing upwards (along the y-axis).\n",
    "\n",
    "The vector (3, 2) means:\n",
    "- Move 3 units along **i-hat** (rightward), and\n",
    "- Move 2 units along **j-hat** (upward).\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, the vector can be written as:\n",
    "- v = 3i + 2j\n",
    "\n",
    "These vectors i-hat and j-hat form a **basis** for the coordinate system. **Basis vectors** are special vectors in the space from which other vectors are constructed by scaling and adding them together.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Changing the Basis\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's introduce the idea of changing the basis. Imagine that someone (let's say **Jennifer**) uses a different set of basis vectors to describe vectors in the same 2D space. Instead of using i-hat and j-hat, she uses two new basis vectors:\n",
    "- **b₁** points **up and right** a little bit,\n",
    "- **b₂** points **left and up**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Jennifer's new basis vectors are different in direction from i-hat and j-hat, so her way of describing a vector will look different.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Translating Between the Two Coordinate Systems\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we want to describe the same vector (3, 2) in both coordinate systems. Using our basis i-hat and j-hat, we already know that:\n",
    "- v = 3i + 2j\n",
    "\n",
    "But in Jennifer's system, the same vector is described differently with the coordinates (5/3, 1/3), meaning:\n",
    "- v = (5/3) * b₁ + (1/3) * b₂\n",
    "\n",
    "This is because Jennifer’s b₁ and b₂ vectors have different directions compared to i-hat and j-hat.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. How to Find the Coordinates in Jennifer's System\n",
    "\n",
    "To find the coordinates of a vector v in Jennifer's coordinate system, we need to express her basis vectors b₁ and b₂ in our coordinate system. The video provides that:\n",
    "- b₁ = (2, 1) (described in our system),\n",
    "- b₂ = (-1, 1) (described in our system).\n",
    "\n",
    "In Jennifer's system, these vectors are represented as:\n",
    "- b₁ = (1, 0),\n",
    "- b₂ = (0, 1).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Translating Between Coordinate Systems with Matrices\n",
    "\n",
    "The video introduces the **change of basis matrix**. This matrix helps us translate vectors from one basis to another.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How it Works:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Suppose you are given a vector in Jennifer’s coordinate system, say (-1, 2).\n",
    "- Jennifer describes this vector as:\n",
    "  - vₖ = -1 * b₁ + 2 * b₂\n",
    "\n",
    "  We know the values of b₁ = (2, 1) and b₂ = (-1, 1) in our coordinate system, so we can compute the result:\n",
    "  - vₖ = -1 * (2, 1) + 2 * (-1, 1)\n",
    "  - vₖ = (-2, -1) + (-2, 2)\n",
    "  - vₖ = (-4, 1)\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, the vector (-1, 2) in Jennifer’s system is equivalent to (-4, 1) in our coordinate system.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Matrix Formulation:\n",
    "\n",
    "This process is essentially **matrix-vector multiplication**. The matrix representing Jennifer’s basis vectors in our coordinate system is:\n",
    "- M = [[2, -1], [1, 1]]\n",
    "\n",
    "By multiplying the vector (-1, 2) with this matrix, we can transform it into our coordinate system.\n",
    "\n",
    "For matrix-vector multiplication:\n",
    "- vₖ = M * [-1, 2]\n",
    "\n",
    "This gives the result:\n",
    "- vₖ = [-4, 1]\n",
    "\n",
    "This means the vector (-1, 2) in Jennifer’s system is represented as (-4, 1) in our system.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "### 1. **Data Analysis and Dimensionality Reduction (PCA)**\n",
    "In many data analysis tasks, you deal with large datasets, often with many features (variables). **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** is one method that helps reduce the complexity of the data by transforming it into fewer dimensions while preserving most of the information.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Eigenvectors**: In PCA, the eigenvectors are the \"directions\" in the feature space that capture the most significant variations in the data.\n",

    "\n",
    "- **Harris Corner Detection**: Eigenvalues are used to measure how much a region of an image differs from a flat region. A corner or edge has strong variations in intensity in multiple directions, which is captured by the eigenvalues of the image's structure tensor.\n",
    "- **SIFT (and similar techniques)**: Eigenvectors help identify key features or points in the image, which are then used to match objects across different images, enabling object detection.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Tracking**\n",
    "In tracking, the goal is to follow an object as it moves across a video or a sequence of frames. **Eigenvalues and eigenvectors** can help in tasks like **optical flow estimation** or **Kalman filters**, which are used to predict the motion of objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Optical Flow**: This is the pattern of motion of objects between consecutive frames in a video. The **eigenvectors** of the flow matrix represent the directions in which motion occurs, and the **eigenvalues** represent the magnitude (speed) of the motion in those directions. By analyzing these, you can track the movement of objects.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Kalman Filter**: It is used for predicting the position of an object in a dynamic environment. Eigenvectors might be involved in the design of the filter when transforming data into a space where tracking becomes easier, and eigenvalues help understand how much uncertainty or noise is in the system.\n",

    "\n",
    "- **Eigenfaces**: A method that uses PCA to reduce the dimensionality of facial images. The **eigenvectors** (called eigenfaces) represent the key features of a face (such as eyes, nose, etc.), and **eigenvalues** tell us how much each feature contributes to the overall facial image.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. **Eigenvectors and Eigenvalues:**\n",
    "   - A **linear transformation** acts on a vector by either stretching, shrinking, or rotating it. If the transformation stretches or shrinks the vector without changing its direction, then that vector is called an **eigenvector**, and the amount by which it is stretched or shrunk is called the **eigenvalue**.\n",
    "   - The equation for an eigenvector and eigenvalue is:  \n",
    "     $$ A \\mathbf{v} = \\lambda \\mathbf{v} $$  \n",
    "     where:\n",
    "     - \\(A\\) is a square matrix (the linear transformation),\n",
    "     - \\(\\mathbf{v}\\) is the eigenvector,\n",
    "     - \\(\\lambda\\) is the eigenvalue.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Eigenvalue Equation:**\n",
    "   - To find eigenvalues, we rearrange the equation:\n",
    "     $$ A \\mathbf{v} - \\lambda \\mathbf{v} = 0 $$\n",
    "   - This can be rewritten as:\n",
    "     $$ (A - \\lambda I) \\mathbf{v} = 0 $$\n",
    "     where \\(I\\) is the identity matrix (same size as \\(A\\)).\n",
    "   - For a nontrivial solution to exist (i.e., a non-zero eigenvector), the matrix \\( (A - \\lambda I) \\) must be singular, meaning its determinant must be zero:\n",
    "     $$ \\det(A - \\lambda I) = 0 $$\n",
    "   - Solving this equation gives us the **characteristic polynomial**, whose roots are the eigenvalues.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Traditional Method for Finding Eigenvalues\n",
    "\n",
    "The typical method to find eigenvalues for a 2x2 matrix involves the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Set up the characteristic equation:**\n",
    "   For a matrix \\( A \\) given by:\n",
    "   $$ A = \\begin{bmatrix} a & b \\\\ c & d \\end{bmatrix} $$\n",
    "   The characteristic equation is:\n",
    "   $$ \\det(A - \\lambda I) = \\det \\begin{bmatrix} a - \\lambda & b \\\\ c & d - \\lambda \\end{bmatrix} = 0 $$\n",
    "   Simplifying the determinant, we get the quadratic characteristic equation:\n",
    "   $$ (a - \\lambda)(d - \\lambda) - bc = 0 $$\n",
    "   Expanding and simplifying, this becomes a quadratic equation in \\(\\lambda\\):\n",
    "   $$ \\lambda^2 - (a+d)\\lambda + (ad - bc) = 0 $$\n",
    "   This is the **characteristic polynomial**. The eigenvalues are the roots of this polynomial, and you can find them using the **quadratic formula**.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Solve the quadratic equation:**\n",
    "   The quadratic formula is:\n",
    "   $$ \\lambda = \\frac{-(a+d) \\pm \\sqrt{(a+d)^2 - 4(ad - bc)}}{2} $$\n",

    "\n",
    "### The Quick Trick for 2x2 Matrices\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, the video introduces a trick to make this process much simpler for **2x2 matrices**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The Three Key Facts\n",
    "\n",
    "The trick leverages three simple facts about 2x2 matrices:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Trace and Eigenvalues:**\n",
    "   - The **trace** of a matrix is the sum of its diagonal elements. For a 2x2 matrix \\( A \\):\n",
    "     $$ \\text{trace}(A) = a + d $$\n",
    "   - A useful fact is that the **sum of the eigenvalues** of the matrix is equal to the trace. That is:\n",
    "     $$ \\lambda_1 + \\lambda_2 = \\text{trace}(A) = a + d $$\n",
    "     This means the **mean** of the eigenvalues is the mean of the diagonal elements:\n",
    "     $$ \\text{mean of eigenvalues} = \\frac{a + d}{2} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Determinant and Eigenvalues:**\n",
    "   - The **determinant** of a matrix is the product of its diagonal elements, and it’s also the **product** of the eigenvalues. For the matrix \\( A \\):\n",
    "     $$ \\det(A) = ad - bc $$\n",
    "     This means:\n",
    "     $$ \\lambda_1 \\times \\lambda_2 = \\det(A) = ad - bc $$\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Finding the Eigenvalues:**\n",
    "   - Given the mean (the trace divided by 2) and the product (the determinant), you can quickly find the eigenvalues.\n",
    "   - Suppose the eigenvalues are \\( \\lambda_1 \\) and \\( \\lambda_2 \\), and we know their sum and product:\n",
    "     - \\( \\lambda_1 + \\lambda_2 = \\text{trace}(A) \\)\n",
    "     - \\( \\lambda_1 \\times \\lambda_2 = \\det(A) \\)\n",
    "   - To find the individual eigenvalues, think of them as two numbers that have a known sum and product. We can use the following method:\n",
    "     - Write the eigenvalues as \\( \\lambda_1 = m + d \\) and \\( \\lambda_2 = m - d \\), where \\( m \\) is the mean of the eigenvalues, and \\( d \\) is the \"distance\" between the eigenvalue and the mean.\n",
    "     - The sum of the eigenvalues is \\( 2m \\), and the product of the eigenvalues is \\( m^2 - d^2 \\), which equals the determinant:\n",
    "       $$ m^2 - d^2 = \\det(A) $$\n",
    "     - Rearranging, we can solve for \\( d \\):\n",
    "       $$ d = \\sqrt{m^2 - \\det(A)} $$\n",
    "     - Therefore, the eigenvalues are:\n",
    "       $$ \\lambda_1 = m + d, \\quad \\lambda_2 = m - d $$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example 1: \n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the matrix:\n",
    "$$ A = \\begin{bmatrix} 8 & 6 \\\\ 8 & 6 \\end{bmatrix} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The **trace** is \\( 8 + 6 = 14 \\), so the mean of the eigenvalues is \\( \\frac{14}{2} = 7 \\).\n",
    "2. The **determinant** is \\( 8 \\times 6 - 8 \\times 6 = 48 - 48 = 0 \\).\n",
    "3. The eigenvalues are:\n",
    "   $$ \\lambda_1 = 7 + \\sqrt{7^2 - 0} = 7, \\quad \\lambda_2 = 7 - \\sqrt{7^2 - 0} = 7 $$  \n",
    "   So, both eigenvalues are 7.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example 2:\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the matrix:\n",
    "$$ A = \\begin{bmatrix} 3 & 1 \\\\ 4 & 1 \\end{bmatrix} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The **trace** is \\( 3 + 1 = 4 \\), so the mean of the eigenvalues is \\( \\frac{4}{2} = 2 \\).\n",
    "2. The **determinant** is \\( 3 \\times 1 - 1 \\times 4 = 3 - 4 = -1 \\).\n",
    "3. The eigenvalues are:\n",
    "   $$ \\lambda_1 = 2 + \\sqrt{2^2 - (-1)} = 2 + \\sqrt{5}, \\quad \\lambda_2 = 2 - \\sqrt{2^2 - (-1)} = 2 - \\sqrt{5} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why is This Trick Faster?\n",
    "\n",
    "- This method works because you don't have to go through the steps of calculating the characteristic polynomial and solving a quadratic equation. Instead, you read the trace and determinant directly from the matrix and apply a simple formula to find the eigenvalues.\n",
    "- It's much quicker and can be done in your head for small matrices.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "This trick for finding eigenvalues is particularly useful for 2x2 matrices, where the trace and determinant give you enough information to compute the eigenvalues quickly without needing to expand the characteristic polynomial. It’s a great shortcut for quickly working with small matrices, especially when you need to make calculations quickly or in real-time scenarios like in physics or engineering.\n"
